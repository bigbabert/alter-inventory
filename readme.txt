This plugin display all your Woocommerce inventory, products and variable products as variation, in user friendly mode on front-end in a reserved page, you can create this page simply adding a shortcode [alterinventory] to a new page. Powerful improvement coming soon: manage your products, add and remove product with barcode input area and fisic shop front-end page.

Place the shortcode, with the needed parameters where you want the inventory to appear. Syntax is:
`[alterinventory orderby={title|sku|stock|price|taglia|colore} sort={ASC|DESC}]`

For example:

`[alterinventory]` will print the inventory, with the items ordered by title.
`[alterinventory orderby=sku]` will print the inventory ordered by SKU.
`[alterinventory orderby=sku sort=DESC]` will print the inventory sorteb by SKU in reverse order.

This plugin allows you to publish a full inventory on a frontend page with a simple shortcode. **Every registerd user** will be able to view it, while unregistered users will get an error message.
